# Multimodal Support

Dynamo supports multimodal models with vLLM v1. In general, multimodal models can be served using the aggregated serving setup with [`agg_multimodal.sh`](../../../examples/backends/vllm/launch/agg_multimodal.sh).

> [!WARNING]
> **LLaVA Model Limitation**: Do not use LLaVA models (e.g., `llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf`) with the standard aggregated serving setup, as they contain keywords that Dynamo cannot yet parse. LLaVA models can still be used with the EPD (Encode-Prefill-Decode) setup described below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Security Requirement**: All multimodal workers require the `--enable-multimodal` flag to be explicitly set at startup. This is a security feature to prevent unintended processing of multimodal data from untrusted sources. Workers will fail at startup if multimodal flags (e.g., `--multimodal-worker`, `--multimodal-processor`) are used without `--enable-multimodal`.
This flag is analogus to `--enable-mm-embeds` in vllm serve but also extends it to all multimodal content (url, embeddings, b64).

# Multimodal EPD Deployment Examples

This section provides example workflows and reference implementations for deploying a multimodal model using Dynamo and vLLM v1 with EPD(Encode-Prefill-Decode) pipeline.

## Use the Latest Release

We recommend using the latest stable release of dynamo to avoid breaking changes:

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ai-dynamo/dynamo)](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/releases/latest)

You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/releases/latest) and check out the corresponding branch with:

```bash
git checkout $(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
```

## Multimodal Aggregated Serving

### Components

- workers: For aggregated serving, we have two workers, [EncodeWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/encode_worker_handler.py) for encoding and [MultimodalPDWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/worker_handler.py) for prefilling and decoding.
- processor: Tokenizes the prompt and passes it to the EncodeWorkerHandler.
- frontend: HTTP endpoint to handle incoming requests.

### Workflow

The EncodeWorkerHandler is responsible for encoding the image and passing the embeddings to the MultimodalPDWorkerHandler via a combination of NATS and RDMA.
The work complete event is sent via NATS, while the embeddings tensor is transferred via RDMA through the NIXL interface.
Its MultimodalPDWorkerHandler then prefills and decodes the prompt, just like the [LLM aggregated serving](README.md) example.
By separating the encode from the prefill and decode stages, we can have a more flexible deployment and scale the
MultimodalPDWorkerHandler independently from the prefill and decode workers if needed.

This figure illustrates the workflow:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  HTTP --> processor
  processor --> HTTP
  processor --image_url--> encode_worker
  encode_worker --> processor
  encode_worker --embeddings--> pd_worker
  pd_worker --> encode_worker
```

***Note*** Aggregated serving supports LLaVA 1.5 7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct today. Disaggregated serving is currently only confirmed for LLaVA (see note below).

```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/backends/vllm
# Serve a LLaVA 1.5 7B model:
bash launch/agg_multimodal_epd.sh --model llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf
# Serve a Qwen2.5-VL model:
bash launch/agg_multimodal_epd.sh --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
```

### Client

In another terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
      "model": "llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "text": "What is in this image?"
            },
            {
              "type": "image_url",
              "image_url": {
                "url": "http://images.cocodataset.org/test2017/000000155781.jpg"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "max_tokens": 300,
      "temperature": 0.0,
      "stream": false
    }'
```

If serving the example Qwen model, replace `"llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf"` in the `"model"` field with `"Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct"`.

You should see a response similar to this:
```json

The bus appears to be stopped out of service. The setting is in a foggy city, giving it a slightly moody atmosphere."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}
```

## Multimodal Disaggregated Serving

### Components

- workers: For disaggregated serving, we have three workers, [EncodeWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/encode_worker_handler.py) for encoding, [MultimodalDecodeWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/worker_handler.py) for decoding, and [MultimodalPDWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/worker_handler.py) for prefilling.
- processor: Tokenizes the prompt and passes it to the EncodeWorkerHandler.
- frontend: HTTP endpoint to handle incoming requests.

### Workflow

In this workflow, we have three workers, [EncodeWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/encode_worker_handler.py), [MultimodalDecodeWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/worker_handler.py), and [MultimodalPDWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/worker_handler.py).
For the LLaVA model, embeddings are only required during the prefill stage. As such, the EncodeWorkerHandler is connected directly to the prefill worker.
The EncodeWorkerHandler is responsible for encoding the image and passing the embeddings to the prefill worker via a combination of NATS and RDMA.
Its work complete event is sent via NATS, while the embeddings tensor is transferred via RDMA through the NIXL interface.
The prefill worker performs the prefilling step and forwards the KV cache to the decode worker for decoding.
For more details on the roles of the prefill and decode workers, refer to the [LLM disaggregated serving](README.md) example.

The bus displays a sign that says \"OUT OF SERVICE\" on its front."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}]}
```

***Note***: disaggregation is currently only confirmed to work with LLaVA. Qwen2.5-VL is not confirmed to be supported.

## Llama 4 family Serving

The family of Llama 4 models is natively multimodal, however, different
from Llava, they do not directly consume image embedding as input
(see the [support metrics](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html#text-generation_1)
from vLLM for the types of multi-modal inputs supported by the model).
Therefore, encoder worker will not be used in the following example and the
encoding will be done along side with prefill.

`meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8` will be used as an example
for the content below. And the system will be H100x8 which can hold one instance
of the model per node.

### Multimodal Aggregated Serving

#### Components

- workers: For aggregated serving, we have one worker, [MultimodalPDWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/worker_handler.py) for prefilling and decoding.

- frontend: HTTP endpoint to handle incoming requests.

#### Workflow

In this workflow, we have [MultimodalPDWorkerHandler](../../../components/src/dynamo/vllm/multimodal_handlers/worker_handler.py) which will encode the image, prefill and decode the prompt, just like the [LLM aggregated serving](README.md) example.

## Multimodal Aggregated Video Serving

This example demonstrates deploying an aggregated multimodal model that can process video inputs.

### Components

- workers: For video serving, we use the [VideoEncodeWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/video_encode_worker.py) for decoding video into frames, and send the frames to [VllmPDWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/worker.py) for prefilling and decoding.
- processor: Tokenizes the prompt and passes it to the VideoEncodeWorker.
- frontend: HTTP endpoint to handle incoming requests.

### Workflow

In this workflow, we have two workers, [VideoEncodeWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/video_encode_worker.py) and [VllmPDWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/worker.py).
The VideoEncodeWorker is responsible for decoding the video into a series of frames. Unlike the image pipeline which generates embeddings,
this pipeline passes the raw frames directly to the VllmPDWorker via a combination of NATS and RDMA.
Its VllmPDWorker then prefills and decodes the prompt, just like the [LLM aggregated serving](README.md) example.
By separating the video processing from the prefill and decode stages, we can have a more flexible deployment and scale the
VideoEncodeWorker independently from the prefill and decode workers if needed.

In this camera angle, the rabbit appears more dynamic and alert, with its breathing more visible, signaling its health and well-being. The camera pans out, and we see the rabbit heading towards the left side of the screen, possibly curious or hunting for food, with its ears perked up again. The lush greenery of the forest unfolds in the background, adding to the feeling of a wild and thriving environment.\n\n\nThe rabbit, upturned slightly while walking, finds a pile of dirt and rocks and sits there, fully clothed, perhaps taking a break from its exploration. There's a mention of a blue bird that appears to perch atop a log, adding a touch of whimsy to the scene. Lastly, the rabbit is observed relaxing on the rocks, resting comfortably, and looking off to the right side—a moment of tranquility in a bustling ecosystem. Throughout the clip, the rabbit's outfit remains the same, allowing for a clear focus on its behavior and characteristics while fitting in its habitat.",

## Multimodal Aggregated Audio Serving

This example demonstrates deploying an aggregated multimodal model that can process audio inputs.

### Components

- workers: For audio serving, we use the [AudioEncodeWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/audio_encode_worker.py) for decoding audio into audio embeddings, and send the embeddings to [VllmPDWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/worker.py) for prefilling and decoding.
- processor: Tokenizes the prompt and passes it to the AudioEncodeWorker.
- frontend: HTTP endpoint to handle incoming requests.

### Workflow

In this workflow, we have two workers, [AudioEncodeWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/audio_encode_worker.py) and [VllmPDWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/worker.py).
The AudioEncodeWorker is responsible for decoding the audio into embeddings.
Its VllmPDWorker then prefills and decodes the prompt, just like the [LLM aggregated serving](README.md) example.
By separating the audio processing from the prefill and decode stages, we can have a more flexible deployment and scale the
AudioEncodeWorker independently from the prefill and decode workers if needed.

This figure illustrates the workflow:
```mermaid

  HTTP --> processor
  processor --> HTTP
  processor --audio_url--> audio_encode_worker
  audio_encode_worker --> processor
  audio_encode_worker --embeddings--> pd_worker
  pd_worker --> audio_encode_worker
```

```bash
pip install vllm["audio"] accelerate # multimodal audio models dependency
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/multimodal
bash launch/audio_agg.sh
```

### Client

In another terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
      "model": "Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "text": "What is recited in the audio?"
            },
            {
              "type": "audio_url",
              "audio_url": {
                "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuekaizhang/Triton-ASR-Client/main/datasets/mini_en/wav/1221-135766-0002.wav"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "max_tokens": 6000,
      "temperature": 0.8,
      "stream": false
    }' | jq
```

You should see a response describing the audio's content similar to
```json
{
  "id": "e2d8d67c37634b309400974eaa058ce8",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "content": "The original content of this audio is:'yet these thoughts affected Hester Pynne less with hope than apprehension.'",
        "refusal": null,
        "tool_calls": null,

## Multimodal Disaggregated Audio Serving

This example demonstrates deploying a disaggregated multimodal model that can process audio inputs.

### Components

- workers: For disaggregated audio serving, we have three workers, [AudioEncodeWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/audio_encode_worker.py) for decoding audio into embeddings,
[VllmDecodeWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/worker.py) for decoding, and [VllmPDWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/worker.py) for prefilling.
- processor: Tokenizes the prompt and passes it to the AudioEncodeWorker.
- frontend: HTTP endpoint to handle incoming requests.

### Workflow

In this workflow, we have three workers, [AudioEncodeWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/audio_encode_worker.py), [VllmDecodeWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/worker.py), and [VllmPDWorker](../../../examples/multimodal/components/worker.py).
For the Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model, audio embeddings are only required during the prefill stage. As such, the AudioEncodeWorker is connected directly to the prefill worker.
The AudioEncodeWorker is responsible for decoding the audio into embeddings and passing them to the prefill worker via RDMA.
The prefill worker performs the prefilling step and forwards the KV cache to the decode worker for decoding.
For more details on the roles of the prefill and decode workers, refer to the [LLM disaggregated serving](README.md) example.

This figure illustrates the workflow:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  HTTP --> processor
  processor --> HTTP
  processor --audio_url--> audio_encode_worker
  audio_encode_worker --> processor
  audio_encode_worker --embeddings--> prefill_worker
  prefill_worker --> audio_encode_worker
  prefill_worker --> decode_worker
  decode_worker --> prefill_worker
```

```bash
pip install vllm["audio"] accelerate # multimodal audio models dependency
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/multimodal
bash launch/audio_disagg.sh
